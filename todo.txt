IMMEDIATE TODO: (the rest is bs)
Port MatrixUCB - done
Finish random_trees - done
Review Algo and Node rewrite - uh
fix messed up matrix initializers
docs!!!
tests! (speed test)


Things to do for rewrite:

Make sure Exp3p works correctly before doing anything else.
Check:
    Node Counts
    Root strategies for ToyStates
    Really look at that shit dog
    You moved the inverse_probs thing which actually breaks it (since the playout(matrix_node_next) call mutates forecasts)
    You also forgot the beta term this whole time. Compare with beta to without

Learn:
    It seems the presense of constructors and copy constructors really made a difference when all that State shit was happening.
    Mostly it was that deleted apply_actions call (lmao), but you should somehow devise other tests

Then move on to matrix ucb and then the bandit style search_parameters

Consider making both Exp3p, MatrixUCB derived classes of this new one
There was one other instance of making something a derived but I don't remember what it was
